  \item Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a collection of subsets of the set $X$. Suppose that $\emptyset$ and $X$ are in $\mathcal{C}$, and that finite unions and arbitrary intersections of elements of $\mathcal{C}$ are in $\mathcal{C}$. Show that the collection $$\T = \{X-C\; |\; C\in\mathcal{C}\}$$ is a topology on $X$.\n
  \indent See Theorem 17.1, proof proceeds similarly, just looking at the opposite side of the equations.
  \item Show that if $A$ is closed in $Y$ and $Y$ is closed in $X$, then $A$ is closed in $X$.\n
  \indent Since $A$ is closed in $Y$, by theorem 17.2, there exists a set $D$ closed in $X$ such that $A=Y\cap D$.
  $Y$ and $D$ are both closed in $X$, and by Theorem 17.1 intersections of closed sets are closed, so $Y\cap D$ is closed, hence $A$ is closed in $X$.
  \item Show that if $A$ is closed in $X$ and $B$ is closed in $Y$, then $A\times B$ is closed in $X\times Y$.\n
  \indent Consider the set $\pi_1^{-1}(X-A)$. This is equivalent to the open set $(X-A)\times Y$, which is open since both $X-A$ and $Y$ are open. Similarly, $\pi_2^{-1}(Y-B)$ is open. The union of these is an open set, since the union of any two open sets is open.
  $$((X-A)\times Y)\cup (X\times (Y-B))$$
  which is precisely the complement of $A\times B$.
  \item Show that if $U$ is open in $X$ and $A$ is closed in $X$, then $U-A$ is open in $X$, and $A-U$ is closed in $X$.\n
  \indent $U,A\subset X$, therefore $U-A = U\cap(X-A)$. $U$ and $X-A$ are both open in $X$, so their intersection is open, so $U-A$ is open.\hspace{5in}\n
  Similarly, $A-U=A\cap (X-U)$. $X-U$ and $A$ are both closed sets, thus their intersection is closed, so $A-U$ is closed. \hspace{5in}
  \item Let $X$ be an ordered set in the order topology. Show that $\overline{(a,b)} \subset [a,b]$. Under what conditions does equality hold? \n
  \indent If $X$ has a minimum or a maximum, denote the minimum by $m$ and the maximum by $n$. Then $X-(a,b) = [m,a) \cup (b, n]$. Otherwise, $X-(a,b)=(-\infty,a]\cup[b,\infty)$. Generally, neither of these sets are open, as an open set in the order topology is an open interval, except at the endpoints. Thus the closure includes $a$ and $b$. The only case where it does not is when $a$ has an immediate successor and $b$ has an immediate predecessor. Then the set $[m,a]$ can be written as $[m,a+1)$, likewise with $b$. The union of these is open, thus in this case $(a,b)$ is it's own closure. Therefore, $\overline{(a,b)}=[a,b]$ if $a$ has no immediate successor and $b$ has no immediate predecessor.\n

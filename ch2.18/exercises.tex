\item Suppose that $f: X\rightarrow Y$ is continuous. If $x$ is a limit point of the subset $A$ of $X$, is it necessarily true that $f(x)$ is a limit point of $f(A)$.\n
\indent Consider the topology on the set $X=\{a,b,c\}$: $\T_1 = \{\{a,b\}, \{b,c\},\{a,b,c\},\emptyset\}$, and the topology on the set $Y=\{d,e\}$: $\T_2 = \{\emptyset, \{d,e\}\}$. The mapping $F: X\rightarrow Y$ is defined such that $f(a)=d,\ f(b)=e,\ f(c)=e$. The limit points of $\{b\}$ are $a$ and $c$. However, the limit point of $\{f(b)\}=\{e\}$ is $d$. $f(c)=e$ cannot be a limit point, since the open set containing it, $\{e\}$, only intersects $\{f(b)\}$ at itself, not any other point. That the mapping is continuous is easy to check.\n
\indent In general, let $V$ be a neighborhood of $f(x)$. Then $f^{-1}(V)$ is an open set of $X$ containing $x$, so it must intersect $A$ at some point $y$. $f(y)\in V$ and $f(y)\in f(A)$, therefore $V$ intersects $f(A)$ at $f(y)$. If $f(y)\in f(x)$ for all such points $y$ then $f(x)$ is not a limit point, but if this is false for all open sets $V$, $f(x)$ will be a limit point of $A$.
\item Let $X$ and $X'$ denote a single set in the two toplogies $\T$ and $\T'$, respectively. Let $i: X'\rightarrow X$ be the identity function.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Show that $i$ is continuous $\leftrightarrow \T'$ is finer than $\T$.\hspace{5in}\n
    \indent Clearly, $i$ is it's own inverse. Then, suppose $i$ is continuous. Then for an open set $V$ of $X$, $i(V)=V$ is an open set of $X'$. Hence, every open set $V$ of $X$ is an open set of $X'$, i.e. $\T'$ is finer than $\T$. \n
    \indent In the other direction, suppose that $\T'$ is finer than $\T$. Then for an open set $V$ of $X$, $i(V)=V$ is in $X'$, so $i$ is continuous.
  \item Show that $i$ is a homeomorphism $\leftrightarrow \T'=\T$.\n
    \indent Suppose $i$ is a homeomorphism. Then $i$ is bijective. This implies that $X=X'$. This also implies that every open sey $U$ of $X$ is open in $X'$, so the topologies must be equivalent. The argument is similar in the other direction.
  \end{enumerate}
\item Given $x_0\in X$ and $y_0\in Y$, show that the maps $f: X\rightarrow X\times Y$ and $g: Y\rightarrow X\times Y$ defined by $f(x)=x\times y_0$ and $g(y)=x_0\times y$ are imbeddings. Let $Z=X\times y_0$. Then

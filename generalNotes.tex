\noindent \textbf{Definitions:} \label{sec:Definitions}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \label{dfn:functionRestriction} $f|A$: The function $f$ restricted to the domain $A$.
  \item \label{dfn:finer} Finer: $\T_1$ is finer than $\T_2$ implies that $\T_2\subseteq \T_1$, in other words, $\T_1$ has all the open sets of $\T_2$ and more.
  \item \label{dfn:basis} A basis for a topology on $X$ is a collection $\mathcal{B}$ of subsets of $X$ (called basis elements) such that for each $x\in X$ there is at least one basis element containing $x$, and if $x$ belongs to the intersection of two basis elements $B_1$ and $B_2$, then there is a basis element $B_3$ containing $x$ such that $B_3 \subset B_1 \cap B_2$. Then the topology generated by the basis is: a subset $U$ of $X$ is open if for each $x\in U$ there is a basis element $B$ such that $x\in B$ and $B\subset U$.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \label{thm:basisUnion} Equivalently, given $X$ and a basis $\mathcal{B}$, the topology generated by the basis is the collection of all unions of elements of $\mathcal{B}$.
    \item \label{thm:basisFiner} Also, $\T'$ is finer that $\T$ if and only if for each $x\in X$ and each basis element $B\in\mathcal{B}$ containing $x$, there is a basis element $B'\in \mathcal{B}'$ such that $x\in B'\subset B$.
  \end{itemize}
  \item \label{dfn:subbasis} Subbasis: a subbasis $\mathcal{S}$ for a topology on $X$ is a collection of subsets of $X$ whose union equals $X$. The topology generated by the subbasis is defined to be the collection of all unions of finite intersections of elements of $\mathcal{S}$.
  \item \label{dfn:dictionaryOrder} Dictionary order for $\R\times\R$ is defined by the basis that is the collection of all open intervals $(a\times b, c\times d)$ where $a<c$, or both $a=c$ and $b<d$.
  \item \label{dfn:lowerLimitTopology} The lower limit topology on $\R$, denoted $\R_\ell$ is defined as the topology with the basis that is the collection of all half open intervals of the form $[a,b) = \{ x\; |\; a\leq x < b \}$
  \item \label{dfn:orderedSquare} The ordered square, $I_o^2$ is defined as $[0,1]\times [0,1]$ in the dictionary order topology.
  \item \label{dfn:projection} Projection: for example, $\pi_1: X\times Y \rightarrow X$ is defined by $\pi_1(x,y)=x$, and $\pi_2(x,y)=y$.
  \item \label{dfn:subspace} Subspace Topology: $Y$ is the \emph{subspace} of $X$ if $Y$ is a subset of $X$, and $X$ is a topological space with topology $\T$, and the \emph{subspace topology} on $Y$ is $\T_Y=\{Y\cap U | U\in \T$.
  \item \label{dfn:intersects} Intersects: $A$ intersects $B$ if $A \cap B \neq \emptyset$
  \item \label{dfn:neighborhood} Neighborhood: If $U$ is an open set containing $x$, then $U$ is a neighborhood of $x$.
  \item \label{dfn:orderTopology} Order Topology: If $S$ is a totally ordered set, then let $\chi$ be the basis made of open rays $S$.
  \item \label{dfn:interior} Interior of $A$ ($\text{Int }A$): The union of all open sets contained in $A$. The interior of an open set is itself.
  \item \label{dfn:closure} Closure of $A$ ($\bar{A}$): The intersection of all the closed sets containing $A$. Equivalently, $A$ together with all of its limit points. The closure of a closed set is itself.
  \item \label{dfn:limitPoint} Limit Point: $x$ is a limit point of $A$ if and only if every neighborhood $U$ of $x$ contains some point $y\in A$ distinct from $x$.
  \item \label{dfn:converge} Convergence: A sequence $x_1, x_2, ...$ converges to $x$ if for every neighborhood $U$ of $x$ there exists some $m_U\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $\forall n>m_U\; x_n\in U$.
  \item \label{dfn:Hausdorff} Hausdorff Space: If for each pair of distinct points $x_1,x_2$ of a topologocal space $X$ there exist \emph{disjoint} neighborhoods $U_1$ and $U_2$ of $x_1$ and $x_2$ respectively, then the space is Hausdorff.
  Related:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \label{thm:FinitePointHausdorff} Every finite point set in a Hausdorff space is closed. (This is weaker than Hausdorff, on it's own, it is the \textbf{$T_1$ axiom.}
    \item \label{thm:LimitPointT1} $X$ satisfies the $T_1$ axiom, $A$ is a subset. Then, the point $x$ is a limit point of $A$ if and only if every neighborhood of $x$ contains infinitely many points of $A$.
  \end{itemize}
  \item \label{dfn:continuous} Continuous: A function $f: X\rightarrow Y$ is said to be continuous if for each open subset $V$ of $Y$, the set $f^{-1}(V)$ is an open subset of $X$. It is sufficient to show that the inverse image of every basis element, or even of every subbasis element is open.
  Equivalently:
  \begin{enumerate} %Theorem 18.1
    \item \label{dfn:continuous2} For every subset $A$ of $X$, $f(\bar{A}) \subset \overline{f(A)}$
    \item \label{dfn:continuous3} For every closed set $B$ of $Y$, the set $f^{-1}(B)$ is closed in $X$.
    \item \label{dfn:continuous4} For each $x\in X$ and each neighborhood $V$ of $f(x)$, there is a neighborhood $U$ of $x$ such that $f(U) \subset V$
  \end{enumerate}
  Note: if the third condition holds for one point, then $f$ is continuous at that point.
  \item \label{dfn:homeomorphism} Homeomorphism: A bijective function $f$ is a homeomorphism is both $f$ and $f^{-1}$ are continuous.
  \item \label{dfn:embedding} Embedding: Let $f: X\rightarrow Y$ be a continuous injective map, and set $Z=f(X)$ considered as a subspace of $Y$; then the function $f': X\rightarrow Z$ obtained by restricting the range of $f$ is bijective. If $f'$ is a homeomorphism, then we say $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is an embedding of $X$ in $Y$.
  Equivalently, $f(U)$ is open if and only if $U$ is open.
  \item \label{dfn:cartesianProducts} \textbf{Cartesian Products}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $\mathcal{A}$ is a nonempty collection of sets. Indexing function for $\mathcal{A}$ is a surjective function $f$ from the index set, $J$, to $\mathcal{A}$. Given $\alpha \in J$, the set $f(\alpha)$ will be denoted $A_\alpha$, the indexed family will be $\{A_\alpha\}_{\alpha\in J}$ or $\{A_\alpha\}$.
    \item Arbitrary unions/intersections: $\displaystyle\bigcup_{\alpha\in J} A_\alpha = \{x |\; \exists \alpha \in J \text{ such that } x\in A_\alpha \}$. $\displaystyle\bigcap_{\alpha\in J} A_\alpha = \{x |\; \forall \alpha \in J,\; x\in A_\alpha \}$.
    \item $m$-Tuples: an $m$-tuple is the function $x: (1,\dots,m)\rightarrow X$. $x(i)$ is typically denoted $x_i$ and called the $i$th coordinate of $x$, and $x$ is denoted $(x_1\dots x_m)$.
    \item Cartesian product. $\{A_1\dots A_m\}$ is a family of sets, indexed by the set $\{1\dots m\}$. $X = A_1 \cup\dots \cup A_m$. The cartesian product $\displaystyle\prod_{i=1}^{m}A_i$ is the set of all $m$-tuples $(x_1,\dots ,x_m)$ of elements of $X$ such that $\forall i\; x_i \in A_i$
    \item $J$-tuple: given an index set $J$ a $J$-tuple is a function $x: J\rightarrow X$. For any $\alpha\in J$, we denote $x(\alpha)$ by $x_\alpha$, we call it the $\alpha$-th coordinate of $x$, and denote the function $x$ by the symbol $(x_\alpha)_{\alpha\in J}$. The set of all $J$-tuples of elements of $X$ is denoted $X^J$.
    \item Cartesian product. $\{A_\alpha\}_{\alpha\in J}$ is an indexed family of sets, $X=\bigcup_{\alpha\in J}A_\alpha$. The cartesian product, $\prod_{\alpha\in J} A_\alpha$ is defined as the set of all $J$-tuples of elements of $X$ such that $x_\alpha \in A_\alpha$ for each $\alpha\in J$. Also denoted $\prod A_\alpha$, and its general element as $(x_\alpha)$ if the index set is understood.
    \item Box Topology: let $(X_\alpha)_{\alpha\in J}$ be an indexed family of topological spaces. Then give the product space $\displaystyle\prod_{\alpha\in J}X_\alpha$ the basis that is the collection of all sets of the form $\displaystyle\prod_{\alpha\in J}U_\alpha$, where $U_\alpha$ is open in $X_\alpha$ for all $\alpha\in J$.
    \item Product topology: Let $\pi_\beta : \displaystyle\prod_{\alpha\in J}X_\alpha \rightarrow X_\beta$ be defined $\pi_\beta((x_\alpha)_{\alpha\in J}) = x_\beta$; it maps each element of the product space to its $\beta$th coordinate, it is the projection mapping associated with index $\beta$. \n
    \indent Let $\mathcal{S}_\beta$ denote the collection $\mathcal{S}_\beta = \{\pi_\beta^{-1}(U_\beta) | U_\beta \text{ is open in } X_\beta\}$. Then let $\mathcal{S}$ denote the union $\mathcal{S}=\displaystyle\bigcup_{\beta\in J}\mathcal{S}_\beta$. The topology generated by subbasis $\mathcal{S}$ is called the product topology, and $\prod_{\alpha\in J} X_\alpha$ is a product space.\n
    \indent From this, we get the basis of the product topology: all sets of the form $\prod U_\alpha$, where $U_\alpha$ is an open set of $X_\alpha$, and is equal to $X_\alpha$ for all but finitely many values of $\alpha$.
  \end{itemize}
  \item \label{dfn:metric} Metrics
  \begin{itemize}
    \item A metric is a function $d: X \times X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that: $d(x,y)>0$ for $x\neq y$, $d(x,x)=0$; $d(x,y)=d(y,x)$; and $d(x,y) + d(y,z)\geq d(x,z)$.
    \item The $\epsilon$-ball centered at $x$ is $B_d(x, \epsilon) = \{ y | d(x,y) < \epsilon \}$.
    \item \label{dfn:metricTopology} The metric topology induced by a metric $d$ on a set $X$ is defined by the basis consisting of all $\epsilon$-balls $B_d(x,\epsilon)$ for all $x\in X$ and $\epsilon > 0$. Alternatively, a set $U$ is open in the metric topology induced by $d$ if and only if for each $y\in U$, there is a $\delta > 0$ such that $B_d(y,\delta) \in U$.
    \item A space is metrizable of there exists a metric on it that induces its topology. A metric space is a metrizable space together with the metric that gives it its topology.
    \item Bounded: A subset $A$ of $X$ is bounded if there exists an $M$ such that for all points $x,y$ $d(x,y)<M$. If $A$ is bounded and nonempty, the diameter of $A$ is defined as $\sup( \{d(x,y) | x,y\in X\})$
    \item Standard Bounded Metric $\bar{d}$: Let $X$ be a metric space with metric $d$. Define $\bar{d}: X\times X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ by the equation $\bar{d}(x,y) = \min(d(x,y),1)$. $\bar{d}$ induces the same topology as $d$.
    \item Euclidean and Square Metrics on $\mathbb{R}^n$: The euclidean metric $d(x,y) = ||x-y|| = ((x_1 - y_1)^2 + \dots + (x_n - y_n)^2)^{1/2}$. The square metric $p(x,y) = \max(|x_1 - y_1|, \dots , |x_n - y_n|)$.
    \item Uniform Metric $\bar{p}$ on $\mathbb{R}^J$, inducing the uniform topology: $\bar{p}(x,y) = \sup(\{\bar{d}(x_\alpha, y_\alpha) | \alpha \in J\})$. The uniform topology is finer than the product topology and coarser than the box topology, and different if $J$ is infinite.
  \end{itemize}
  \item \label{dfn:countableBasis} Countable Basis at Point $x$: one exists if there is a countable collection $\{U_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{Z}_+}$ of neighborhoods of $x$ such that any neighborhood $U$ of $x$ contains at least one of the sets $U_n$. A space that has a countable basis at each of its points satisfies the \emph{first countability axiom}. All metrizable spaces satisfy this axiom.
  \item \label{dfn:convergesUniformly} Let $(f_n): X\rightarrow Y$ be a sequence of functions where $Y$ is a metric space with metric $d$. The sequence converges uniformly to the function $f:X\rightarrow Y$, if given any $\epsilon>0$ there exists an integer $N$ such that $d(f_n(x), f(x))<\epsilon$ for all $n>N$ and for all $x\in X$.  If $(f_n)$ converges uniformly to $f$ and each $f_n$ is continuous, then $f$ is continuous.

\begin{itemize}
  %\item Chapter 2, Section 18
  %\begin{enumerate}
  %  \setcounter{enumi}{0}
    \item \label{thm:AxiomChoice} The axiom of choice: given a collection $\mathcal{A}$ of disjoint nonempty sets, there exists a set $C$ consisting of exactly one element from each element of $\mathcal{A}$; that is, a set $C$ such that $C$ is contained within the union of elements of $\mathcal{A}$, and for each $A\in\mathcal{A}$, the set $C\cap A$ contains a single element.
    \item \label{thm:BelongsClosure17.5} Theorem 17.5:  $x\in \bar{A}$ if and only if every open set $U$ or basis element $B$ containing $x$ intersects $A$.
    \item \label{thm:PastingLemma} Pasting Lemma: let $X=A\cup B$ where $A$ and $B$ are closed int $X$. Let $f: A\rightarrow Y$ and $g: B\rightarrow Y$ be continuous. If $f(x)=g(x)$ fo every $x\in A\cap B$ then $f$ and $g$ combine to give a continuous function $h: X\rightarrow Y$ defined by setting $h(x) = f(x)$ if $x\in A$ and $h(x) = g(x)$ if $x\in B$.
    \item \label{thm:LocalFormulationContinuity} The local formulation of continuity: If $X$ can be written as the union of upen sets $U_\alpha$ such that $f|U_\alpha$ is continuous for each $\alpha$, then the map $f: X\rightarrow Y$ is continuous.
    \item \label{thm:ChangingRangeDomainContinuity} Restricting the domain, or restricting or expanding the range of a continuous function will yield a continuous function.
    \item \label{thm:MapsProducts18.4} Theorem 18.4 - Maps into products. Let $f : A\rightarrow X\times Y$ be given by $f(a)=(f_1(a),f_2(a))$. Then $f$ is continuous if and only if $f_1$ and $f_2$ (the coordinate functions of $f$) are continuous.
    \item \label{thm:MapsProducts19.6} Theorem 19.6: Let $f: A \rightarrow \prod_{\alpha\in J}X_\alpha$ be defined $f(a) = (f_\alpha(a))_{\alpha \in J}$, where $f_\alpha : A \rightarrow X_\alpha$ for each $\alpha$. Let $\prod X_\alpha$ have the product topology. Then $f$ is continuous if and only if each $f_\alpha$ is continuous.
    \item \label{thm:SequenceContinuity21.3} Theorem 21.3 and Lemma 21.2 (The Sequence Lemma) - If there is a sequence of points of $A$ converging to $x$, then $x\in \bar{A}$, the converse holds if $X$ has a countable basis at point $x$, or, more strongly, if $X$ is metrizable. If a function $f$ is continuous, then for every convergent sequence $x_n\rightarrow x$ in $X$, the sequence $f(x_n)$ converges to $f(x)$, again the converse holds if $X$ has a countable basis at $x$.

3. Let $X$ be the set $\{0,1\}$. Show that there is a bijective correspondense between $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{Z}_+)$ and the cartesian product $X^\omega$ \n
Let $x=(x_1, x_2, x_3, ...)\in X$ where each $x_i\in \{0,1\}$. \n
Now define the map
$$f : X^\omega \rightarrow \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{Z}_+)$$
to be
$$f(x) = \{i\, |\, x_i=1\}$$
$f$ is injective - consider $x_a, x_b$ such that $f(x_a)=f(x_b)$.
Then for each $i$, $x_{ai}=x_{bi}$, so $x_a=x_b$ \n
Furthermore, $f$ is surjective. For each $n\in\mathbb{Z}_+$, each subset of $\mathbb{Z}_+$ either contains $n$ or does not. $X$ contains every sequence where $x_n$ is 1 ($n$ is in the subset) and all those where $x_n$ is 0 ($n$ is not in the subset).

5a,b) Countablely infinite, there's a bijective mapping to $\mathbb{Z}_+^n$.
The set $B_n$ can be bijectively mapped to the set of subsets of $\mathbb{Z}_+$ of size $n$.\n
c) Uncountable, equivalent to $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{Z}_+)$.\n
d,e) Uncountable, assigning a 0 or 1 to each element in $\mathbb{Z}_+$ was shown to be equivalent to $X^\omega$ in 3), which is uncountably infinite.\n
f) Countable, there is one such function for every choice of whether $n$ is 0 or 1 for all $n$ up to $N$, thus there are $2^N$ such functions.\n
g) Countable infinite, it's simply the number of subsets of $\mathbb{Z}_+$ of size N.\n
h) A countable union of the above, thus it is countably infinite.\n
